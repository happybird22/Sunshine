What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
More time on planning since I was mostly filling in the pages with a loose idea instead of wireframes

Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
Not difficult but I did not like having to include a gif as it made the whole site feel less professional.

What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?
I want to keep working on the site and include new pages for each of the cards I created and build it out into a full and functional site.

Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.
I need to review margin formatting. I also liked using boxicon as a font linked in my header for easy access to icons throughout my code.

References: Bro Code youtube used to review certain coding processes, boxicon used for icons.
